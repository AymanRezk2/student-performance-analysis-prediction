# Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance using **unsupervised and supervised machine learning** techniques.
The goal is to understand behavioral and home factors affecting academic outcomes and to predict whether students are struggling and their final grades (`G3`).

## Dataset

* Source: Student academic and personal dataset (demographics, family support, habits, and grades).
* Key Features:

  * Behavioral: `studytime`, `absences`, `goout`, `freetime`, `famsup`, `schoolsup`
  * Home-related: `famsize`, `Pstatus`, `Medu`, `Fedu`, `Mjob`, `Fjob`, `guardian`
  * Academic: `G1`, `G2`, `G3`, `study_efficiency`, `is_struggling`
  * Lifestyle: `Dalc`, `Walc`, `alcohol_ratio`, `goout_freetime`, `freetime`, `health`

## Methodology

### 1. Unsupervised Learning: K-Means

* **Behavior Clustering**: Segment students based on study habits and social activities to see behavioral impact on grades.
* **Home Clustering**: Segment students based on family and home environment to analyze influence on performance.
* **Outcome**: Identified clusters with varying average grades (`G3`) and typical behavioral/home profiles.

### 2. Supervised Learning: Classification

* **Goal**: Predict if a student is struggling (`target`).
* **Models Tested**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost.
* **Data Handling**: Removed `target`, `G3`, `G1G2_avg`, and cluster labels to avoid data leakage.
* **Imbalanced Classes**: Applied class weights in CatBoost and Random Forest for better minority class performance.
* **Selected Features**:

selected\_features = \[
"study\_efficiency", "is\_struggling", "goout\_freetime", "studytime\_failures",
"famrel", "alcohol\_ratio", "parent\_edu", "higher", "freetime", "age",
"Fedu", "health", "Walc","goout", 'Medu'
]

* **Best Model**: Random Forest
* **Final Performance**:

  * Accuracy: 0.90
  * Minority class (`0`) F1-score: 0.43
  * Majority class (`1`) F1-score: 0.95

### 3. Supervised Learning: Regression

* **Goal**: Predict exact final grades (`G3`) using `G1G2_avg`, `study_efficiency`, and `is_struggling`.
* **Model**: Linear Regression
* **Performance**:

  * R²: 0.822
  * RMSE: 1.736

## Key Insights

* Students with **strong family and school support** tend to achieve **higher grades**.
* Behavioral patterns like consistent study time and moderate social activities correlate with better performance.
* Home environment significantly affects outcomes: supportive parents and educated family members boost results.
* Predictive models can identify struggling students early and estimate final grades with reasonable accuracy.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone \<repo\_url>

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run notebooks:

   * `KMeans_Analysis.ipynb` → Behavioral & Home Clustering
   * `Classification_Model.ipynb` → Predict struggling students
   * `Regression_Model.ipynb` → Predict final grades

## Conclusion

Combining **behavioral, home, and academic features** allows us to **segment students effectively**, predict struggling cases, and estimate final grades. This approach can help educators **personalize interventions** and improve overall student performance.
